## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Size ≠ Quality in Swarm Learning
Despite being the smallest model, Haiku achieved the **best results**. This suggests that in collaborative multi-agent scenarios, **efficiency and iteration count matter more than raw model capability.**

### 2. Extremely Tight Performance Clustering
All models found nearly identical solutions (max 0.003 BPB difference). This indicates:
- The swarm architecture is robust across model sizes
- The problem has good convergence properties
- All three models are "capable enough" for this task

### 3. Temporal Efficiency Matters
Opus's 26% lower throughput (0.18 vs 0.23 runs/min) stems from longer inference time (326s vs 260s per run). In fixed-time experiments, this directly reduces solution quality opportunity.

### 4. Haiku is Reproducible
Only Haiku has 2 independent trials (10+ hours apart), showing exceptional consistency (0.27% variance). This increases confidence in its performance.

## 🔬 For Further Research

**Questions this analysis raises:**
1. Does heterogeneous swarm (Haiku + Sonnet) outperform homogeneous?
2. What if we allocate different models to different agents?
3. How do results scale with 4+ agent swarms?
4. Is there a "sweet spot" swarm size × model capability combination?
