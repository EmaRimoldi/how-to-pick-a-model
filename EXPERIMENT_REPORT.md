# Experiment Report

## Status

The repository now contains a working first-pass framework for the canonical C(a) protocol: one online trajectory, six mode-constrained candidate branches per step, offline verification for all branches, and top-1-only branch promotion.

## Implemented

- Ported stateful query-engine benchmark components into `benchmarks/stateful_query_engine/`.
- Added `src/vao/` package with schemas, taxonomy, classifier, verifier wrapper, branch workspaces, adapters, orchestrator, visibility policies, estimators, analysis scripts, and routing dataset export.
- Added configs, scripts, tests, project log, assumptions, TODO, and README.
- Added deterministic `local_stub` backend for reproducible framework validation without external model access.

## Smoke Run

Command:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src:. python -m vao.orchestrator --config configs/phase1_dev.yaml --models local_stub --profiles paper_development --steps 2 --run-id smoke_local_stub
```

Results:

- Run directory: `runs/phase1_dev/smoke_local_stub`
- Steps completed: 2
- Branch evaluations: 12
- Branches per step: 6
- Visibility regime: `top1_only`
- Promoted modes: `indexing`, then `caching`
- Baseline loss: `1.0063325319491947`
- Best visible loss: `0.14148213936363915`
- Best counterfactual loss: `0.14148213936363915`

Generated artifacts:

- `artifacts/phase1_dev_estimators.csv`
- `artifacts/baseline_eval.json`
- `artifacts/routing_all.jsonl`
- `artifacts/routing_train.jsonl`
- `artifacts/routing_dev.jsonl`
- `artifacts/tables_endpoint.md`

## Validation

Commands run:

```bash
pytest -q
PYTHONPATH=src:. python -m benchmarks.stateful_query_engine.dynamic_benchmark --solution benchmarks/stateful_query_engine/solution_template.py --profile paper_development --out artifacts/baseline_eval.json
PYTHONPATH=src:. python -m vao.verifier --smoke_test
PYTHONPATH=src:. python -m vao.analysis.compute_estimators --runs runs/phase1_dev --out artifacts/phase1_dev_estimators.csv
PYTHONPATH=src:. python -m vao.training.build_routing_dataset --runs runs/phase1_dev --train_out artifacts/routing_train.jsonl --dev_out artifacts/routing_dev.jsonl --out artifacts/routing_all.jsonl
```

Validation result:

- `pytest -q`: 15 passed.
- Direct dynamic benchmark: baseline solution correct on `paper_development`.
- Verifier smoke: baseline solution correct on `paper_development`.
- Smoke artifact check: every branch contains `parent_solution.py`, `proposed_solution.py`, `patch.diff`, `proposal.json`, and `verification.json`.

## Known Gaps

- Claude Code and OpenAI-compatible adapters are scaffolds that fall back to `local_stub`.
- Shared-checkpoint controlled phi and full C(b) pre/post feedback-use diagnostics are not implemented beyond shared estimator/scaffold functions.
- Routing LoRA training is intentionally scaffolded only; no model training was run.
- The PDFs were not parsed because `pdftotext` is unavailable; the Markdown implementation guide was used as the operational source of truth.
